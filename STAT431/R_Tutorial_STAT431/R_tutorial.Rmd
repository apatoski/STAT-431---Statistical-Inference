# Before We Start
There is much more information here than you will actually need for this course (STAT 431) but you can use it as an additional reference. If you want to run and compile this R markdown file into a nice html like this, follow the instructions in `getting_started.rtf`. If you just want the R code that was run in this file, take a look at the `R_tutorial_insession.R` script in this directory.

# Installing R
The easiest way to get the R environment up and running on your system is to insall a precompiled binary distribution from <http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/>, Choose the binary for your system and the step by step instructions should be just like installing any other application. 

# Installing RStudio
RStudio is an excellent GUI for coding in R. It integrates the command line, graphical file directory explorer, graphical environment/variable inspector, and figure/plot output. I suggest that you install the binary file to your machine. You can find the download link at <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/> under the *Installers for Supported Platforms* list. Choose the link that corresponds to your OS. The installation should be just like installing any other program from the web at this point.

# Preliminaries
We'll start with some pretty important basic commands you will need to get you up and started in R.

## A few basic notes on syntax and creating an R document
After opening up RStudio you will want to open a new R Script by going to `File > New File > R Script`. We can now input code (to be executed) and comments (to describe the code) into your script which we can evaluate in our current R session. You can also enter commands directly into the Console but for complicated analysis you want to be able to reproduce, you'll want to write your analysis in a script you can run again and again.
```{r}
# This is a comment
x <- pi # this assigns the variable x the value π
paste("π is approximately",x) # this concatenates strings separated by spaces
# these two operations do the same thing:
x <- cos(pi) # prefered syntax
x =  cos(pi)
```
You can evaluate code in your script several ways:

* Evaluate current line: <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>ret</kbd>
* Evaluate selection by selecting code block and using the keystroke combo above
* Evaluate entire script: <kbd>opt</kbd>+<kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>

Here are a few more nice key shortcuts:

* Move cursor to script editor: <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd>
* Move cursor to console editor: <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>2</kbd>
* Clear the console: <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd>

## Setting your working directory
Your working director is where R will find and save data files, plots, etc.
```{r}
getwd()                # Get your current working directory
setwd("~/TA/STAT471/R_Tutorial_STAT471") # Set working directory (where R will search for files)
# or...
dir <- "~/TA/STAT471/R_Tutorial_STAT471"
setwd(dir)             # pass the string variable dir to setwd()
```
Here's an example of how to read in a .csv data file located in your working directory:
```{r}
	radio=read.csv("Survey_results_final.csv", header=T, na.strings="")		
  # comma is default seperator for read.csv: sep=","
  # with some different options now
	radio=read.csv("Survey_results_final.csv",header=T, stringsAsFactors=F,as.is=T, na.strings="")
```

## HELP!!! How to get it
Getting help is pretty straightforward in R. Here are a few ways to get help on the function we just saw. The first three commands don't output anything to your command line but open up a help file in the help viewer.
```{r}
?read.csv
??read.csv
help(read.csv)
apropos("read")	#	List all the functions with "read" as part of the function. Very useful!

# google: R: how to import a data set? 
# If you pair "R" with some phrase related 
# to stats or data google usually does a good job

args(read.csv) # list all the arguments
str(read.csv)  # string representation of read.csv function
# ... both of these show you the defaul arguments (if there are any)

```

## Packages: what are they and how to install them
We will be using many statistical and machine learning algorithms, plotting functions, and datasets that are not available in the base distribution of R. R is an open source statistical language so many contributors write statistical packages that have functions that allow us to apply the algorithms we learn about in class to actual data! 
```{r}
# Many packages available. We only need a few.
if(!any(installed.packages()[,1]=="MASS")) install.packages("MASS")
library(MASS)       # load package MASS
help(package=MASS)  # get information about MASS

installed.packages()[1:10,1] # packages installed (first 10)
pckgs.all <- available.packages("http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/contrib/3.2")
# get all the package with "knn" as part of the name
grep("knn", rownames(pckgs.all), val=T) 
# get first 10 packages with "plot" as part of the name
grep("plot", rownames(pckgs.all), val=T )[1:10]
```


# Cleaning and examining the data
Before you conduct your analysis it is always wise to take a quick look at the data and try to spot anything abnormal such as missing data.

## Quick Check
In R, data is usually stored in an object called a data.frame. Each row is an observation and each column is a variable/feature. 
```{r}
class(radio)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
str(radio) # make sure the variables are correctly defined.
```

## Get a table view
If our dataset is not too big, we can graphically inspect the data in an Excel-like table with
```{r, eval=FALSE}
View(radio) # note that case matters in R
```

##	Inspect the first (or last) few rows
This doesn't display nicely when there are a lot of columns.
```{r,eval=FALSE}
head(radio) # or tail(radio), or head(radio,10) -- the first 10 rows
```
In this case, the graphical `View()` command is a better option.

## Find the size of the data or the numbers or rows and columns
```{r}
dim(radio)
```

## Get the variable names
```{r}
names(radio)[1:10] # hear we look at only the first 10
```

## Work with a subset which includes relevant variables
Below we see one method of subsetting; we specify the desire columns to keep with a vector of column indices.
```{r}
radio1=radio[, c( 24,28:33)] # take columns 24, 28, ... 33
str(radio1)
```
```{r,eval=FALSE}
View(radio1)
head(radio1)
```
```{r}
dim(radio1)
summary(radio1)
```


## rename the varables
```{r}
names(radio1)
names(radio1)=c("worktime", "age", "education", "gender", "income", "sirius", "wharton")
names(radio1)
str(radio1) # Notice that age is not a continuous variable, why?
```

## Cleaning up the data: subsetting data
Sometimes data is coded improperly - numerical value recorded as a string, variable X recorded in column Y, etc. - and we need to correct this. Here we see a different type of subsetting; We provide a vector of booleans that are TRUE for the indices we are subsetting.
```{r}
summary(radio1)
levels(radio1$age)

# need to take care of "27`", "Eighteen (18)", "female" and "223"
radio1$age[radio1$age == "27`"] <- 27
radio1$age[radio1$age == "Eighteen (18)"] <- 18
radio1$age[radio1$age == "female"] <- NA

radio1$age=as.character(radio1$age)
radio1$age=as.numeric(radio1$age)
```

## Summarizing data
We can use histograms (at least for continuous variables) and summary statistics to get a picture of the distribution of the features in our dataset.
```{r}
summary(radio1$age)
radio2=radio1[(radio1$age >15) & (radio1$age < 100), ]
hist(radio2$age, breaks=10, main="Hist of age", xlab="age")
# use a large number as break points to see the details
```


## Excluding missing data: more subsetting
Here we only want to consider data associated with Wharton and Sirius radio.
```{r}
radio1=radio1[!is.na(radio1$sirius),]
radio1=radio1[!(radio1$sirius==""),]
radio1=radio1[!is.na(radio1$wharton),]
radio1=radio1[!(radio1$wharton==""),]
dim(radio1)
paste("The complete data has", dim(radio1)[1], "cases")
str(radio1)
```

## Check that each variable in data frame is of correct type
We want to make sure that the categorical variables are of class `factor`.
```{r}
radio1$wharton=as.factor(radio1$wharton)
radio1$sirius=as.factor(radio1$sirius)
radio1$gender=as.factor(radio1$gender)
radio1$income=as.factor(radio1$income)
str(radio1)
summary(radio1)
```

## Save our cleaned data frame to a .csv file   
`write.csv` is the companion function to `read.csv`.
```{r}
# row.names=T  by default, we usually don't want these
write.csv(radio1, file="Radio_Survey_Clean.copy", row.names=F) 
temp=read.csv("Radio_Survey_Clean.copy", header=T)
dim(temp)
str(temp)
head(temp)
```

## A primer on simple linear regression and plotting
The `lm()` command stands for linear model and allows you to run regressions as you would in JMP or Stata, for example. Here we'll run a quick analysis of the relationship between tipping behavior and total bill size.

# Reading in data 
```{r}
fName <- "tips.txt" # store your file name as a string variable
# (see also "read.table" for another function to read in data)
tips <- read.csv(fName, header = T, sep=",", stringsAsFactors = T)
```

# Taking a peak around
```{r}
dim(tips)      # the size of the data
head(tips)     # look at the first few entries
head(tips, 10) # look at the first ten entries
names(tips)    # see the name of the columns
summary(tips)  # get a simple summary of each variable
```

# Accessing variables in data frame
We've already seen one of these methods.
```{r}
tips[1,1]            # all equivalent ways 
tips[1,"total_bill"]  # of accessing the same 
tips$total_bill[1]     # variable in the data frame
```

## Creating a new variable as a function of other variables
It's easy!
```{r}
tips$percent <- 100*tips$tip/tips$total_bill # create a new variable
```

# Plotting
Here are some basic but important plotting functions that come with the base distribution of R. For the most part, this is all you'll need give or take a few other plot types (i.e. qqplot(),qqline(),abline())

## A very basic plot
```{r}
plot(tips$total_bill,tips$percent) 
```

## The same plot with some bells and whistles
```{r}
plot(tips$total_bill, tips$percent, 
     main = "Total Bill v. Percent Tip", # give plot a title
     xlab = "Percent",    # label the x-axis
     ylab = "Total Bill", # label the y-axis
     pch = 16,            # change the type of plot point
     col = "red",         # set the color of plot point
     lwd = 2,             # set the line width
     xlim = c(0, 60),     # change limits of x-axis
     ylim = c(0,50))      # change the limits of y-axis
```

## You can also just set a few options
```{r}
plot(tips$total_bill, 
     tips$percent, 
     col="red", 
     main="Total Bill v. Percent Tip")
```

## A few more useful plot types
```{r}
hist(tips$percent, breaks=10)                               # A histogram
boxplot(tips$percent ~ tips$sex, main = "Tip by Sex")       # A boxplot
boxplot(tips$percent ~ tips$smoker, main = "Tip by Smoker") # Another boxplot
```

## Saving Plots
```{r}
pdf("boxplot.pdf") # open pdf graphics device;
                   # analogous commands: jpeg(), png()
boxplot(tips$percent ~ tips$sex) # A boxplot
dev.off()                        # close device and 
                                 # save plot to pdf
```

## A simple linear regression
```{r}
model <- lm(percent ~ total_bill, data = tips) # save your regression as an object
model # show modelling results
model.summary <- summary(model) # save the results summary as an object
model.summary # show more detailed results

# model.summary has accessible attributes
names(model.summary)
# an example
model.summary$coefficients # a matrix of the coeffs, SEs, t-stat, p-val 

# plotting the results
plot(tips$total_bill, 
     tips$percent, 
     col="red", 
     main="Total Bill v. Percent Tip")
abline(model) # add best fit line

```

# Appendix: Basic Operations
You can perform basic math, vector algebra, etc. using R. In fact, these basic commands are the building blocks of many of the sophisticated methods you will learn later in the course.
## R as a calculator
R is all about functions. There are many built in functions and you can even define your own. Here are some familar ones:
```{r}
1 + 1
exp(2)
pi
log(3) # this is the NATURAL log not base 10.
cos(2)
```

## Variables
We can assign values to variables in our workspace. 
```{r}
x <- 1 # assign a value to x
x      # print the value of x
ls()            # see what variables are stored in your workspace
rm(x)           # remove x from your workspace
rm(list = ls()) # remove everything in your workspace (very handy trick)
```

## Vectors and Vector Arithmetic
The `c()` function "collects" variables of the same class. We use it below to collect numbers into a vector and collect vectors into another vector
```{r}
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5) # variables can store collections of numbers
y <- 11:15  # use ":" as a quick way to write sequence of numbers
z <- c(x,y) # glue two vectors together

length(x)   # find the length of x
sum(x)      # find the sum of elements in x
max(x)      # find the maximum value, ...

x[1] <- 100 # change the value at a location
x

y[c(2,3)] <- c(1,1) # change the value at multiple locations
y

x
x > 2    # which x are bigger than 2
x[x > 2] # select the elements of x bigger than 2

z <- x + y # math is done "component wise"
z

x * y   # element by element multiplication
sqrt(x) # even "scalar" functions operate on vectors

# you can also perform standard vector alegebra
# such as dot products (not elementwise)

t(y)       # take the transpose - makes y a column vector
x %*% t(y) # dot product
```

## Matrices
```{r}
A <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6),nrow=3,ncol=2) # elements are stored columnwise!
A

A[3,2] <- 1 # can change and access elements of a matrix
A[,1] # or a column
A[3,] # or a row
```
